# Ship-Identifcation-via-Adjacent-branched-Saliency-and-Prior-Representation-based-Classifcation
We propose a novel ship identifcation method by employing adjacent-branched saliency fltering and prior representation-based classifcation strategies, which achieves high-precision type recognition performance for large and medium-sized ships under complex environmental interference conditions.
